            <h1>Learning Use Your Drone</h1>
            <p>Learning to use a drone for recreational or business purposes can be difficult, fun, and and rewarding.
                The following website will introduce you to the basics of drone hardware, flight basics and
                continuing education, including the certification needed for commercial use.</p>

            <h2>Drone Hardware</h2>
            <img class="photos" src="images\phantom.png" alt="Drone">
            <p>Drones come in all shapes and sizes. There are racing drones made for speed and maneuvaribility,
                aerial photography, as well as government and military applications. This is not a discussion of large scale
                &quot;military strike&quot; drones, but rather, relatively small battery operated types.  Most drones consist
                 of these basic parts:</p>
             </div>
        <div class="Hardware">
            <h3>Propellers</h3>
            <img class="photos" src="images\props.jpg" alt="Props">
            <p>Drones typically employ four propellers to elevate and stabilize the aircraft. There are, however, many different designs
                that incorporate as many as eight or more propellers. Stabilization is achieved by creating an equal downward force from
                each propeller.  Moving forward can be achieved by having slightly less force from the front propellers than the rear,
                left by more force from the right, etc.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="Hardware">
            <h3>Communications</h3>
            <img class="photos" src="images\coms.jpg" alt="Coms">
            <p>All drones must have a system in place to communicate with the user. This system could simply be a Bluetooth connection
                to your smartphone, or an advanced proprietary high speed data transmission system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Hardware">
            <h3>Flight Control System</h3>
            <img class="photos" src="images\controller.jpg" alt="Controller">
            <p>The &quot;Brains&quot; of the drone are in the flight control systems. These systems can vary from basic communications and power
                systems, to advanced automated flight controls, telemetry systems, and photography controls. The most basic requirements
                of a FCS is some type of physical input system (remote controller), communications with the user, and pushing those
                outputs to the propellers.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="Flight">
            <h2>Flight Basics</h2>
            <p>Learning to fly an aerial drone can be a very challenging endeavor, depending on the device being used. It is usually
                recommended to begin learning how to fly using a cheaper, and durable, drone. The benfit of this, besides not destroying
                a $1,000 device, is that the cheaper drones have less automated flight features, allowing you to learn the controls
                without much help.  Once you have mastered these controlls, the more advanced drones will be simple to fly.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="Flight">
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <img class="photos" src="images\instructions.png" alt="Controls">
            <p>The most basic drone controls usually employ two joysticks. The left stick controls the altitude and rotation, while the
            right stick controls directional movement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Flight">
            <h2>Continuing Education</h2>
            <img class="photos" src="images\education.png" alt="Education Pic">
            <p>Learning to fly a drone can be as involved and as detailed as you would like it to be. To use a drone in commercial applications,
             you will need to pass an exam and register your drone for commercial use. The <a href="http:\\www.faa.gov">FAA</a> controls this process.</p>

    <h3>NASA Proves Humans Fly Drones Better Than AI</h3>
    <h5>By Lauren Sigfusson </h5>
    <p>&quot;While the autonomous drone flew more consistently, it just didn&apos;t measure up to the human pilot&apos;s skill. On the official laps, Loo
    averaged 11.1 seconds and the AI-piloted drones averaged 13.9 seconds. Better luck next time, AI.&quot;</p>
